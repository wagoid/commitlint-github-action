  firstParent:
    description: >
      When set to true, we follow only the first parent commit when seeing a merge commit.

  token:
    description: >
      Personal access token (PAT) used to interact with the GitHub API. By default, the
      automatic token provided by GitHub is used. You can see more info about GitHub's default token

    required: false
  excludeTargetBranch:
    description: >
      When set to `true` excludes commits from the target branch. This is useful on merge commits of two
      divergent branches. By default all of the commits in the target branch that are not in the source
      branch will be linted again. Set this to `true` to avoid that.

      TODO: This explanation can be made better when I better understand why `--firstParent` alone didn't resolve this.
      To do that I need to understand what `git log <revision range>` is doing.
    default: "false"
